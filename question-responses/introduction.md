My name is Cutler, and IGN has been a constant in my life for over 15 years. I've been a gamer all my life, but I first discovered IGN in 9th grade. I had just gotten a Wii, I had a little more allowance to buy (used) games than I'd had in middle school, and I needed to know how to spend it. In desperate need of reviews, that's when I found IGN.

I soon started devouring IGN's other content, too. In band class, I would hide my Blackjack 2 smartphone in the bell of my French horn and read Wii game reviews every day. In my graphic design class I would listen to Nintendo Voice Chat with Bozon and Cassamasina and, once I got an Xbox 360, Podcast Unlocked with Hil Goldstein back when it was called Three Red Lights, as well as, of course, Podcast Beyond with Greg and Colin. The hosts have come and gone, but IGN has always been a place of comfort as my life has progressed through high school, college, moving from my home in Georgia to the big city of Los Angeles, and all the years since. Whether it's been Jessica Chobot's Daily Fix, Marty Sliva's hatred of Battletoads, or Alanah Pearce making fun of Marty's hatred of Battletoads, IGN has been there for me when I've been depressed or anxious or stressed, giving me a place to read and listen to people I love talk about video games.

After college, I wanted to work in entertainment, though I wasn't sure in what capacity. I did that for a few years in a few different jobs, thinking I would eventually fall into something I enjoyed, but I never did. After I left my last job, I started learning programming just to give myself something to do while I decided what job to take next, hoping to avoid sitting around doing nothing all day, and after doing that for a while, I realized... I liked programming a lot more than I had liked anything in entertainment.

I started studying web development full-time a little over a year and a half ago and I love it. I've never had anything else that so consistently puts me in a flow state, where the time just flies by until I realize I haven't left my desk to pee for six hours. I'm excited for my skills to finally have reached a level where I can get a job with them. I still have a lot to learn, and I can't think of any place better than IGN—and I know I could be useful at IGN, too. Whether on my phone or on my computer, I check IGN about 5-10 times a day, which gives me valuable insight into the user experience on the site. Over the years, I've consistently (and respectfully) emailed and tweeted the IGN dev team about technical issues on the site that need fixing or improving, and I would love the opportunity to enhance my own skill by making my favorite website a better place.
