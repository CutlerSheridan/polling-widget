# Polling Widget

## A real-time polling widget about Persona 5

Cast a vote and anyone else looking at the poll on their own device will immediately see your vote reflected. Persona 5 ransom-style letters are randomized and will look different every page load.

## IGN Code Foo 2023

### INTRODUCTION

You can read about how IGN has been with me most of my life and why I'd love to intern there [here](https://github.com/CutlerSheridan/polling-widget/blob/main/question-responses/introduction.md).

### POLLING WIDGET

~~See the deployed page [here](https://cutlersheridan.github.io/polling-widget)~~ , or the raw code in the `/src/` folder.

I think it turned out looking really good, and all the votes are from real people from Reddit. I'm playing Persona 5 Royal right now and thought I'd use that as inspiration. This was my first time integrating a database where data was watched and updated in real-time for all users and it was fun getting everything to work. I also had a really good time analyzing various elements of the game's UI, especially [the pause menu](https://images.gamebanana.com/img/ss/mods/62d1324c5bd85.jpg), and figuring out how to recreate the _feel_ of the game.

I used Firebase for the database. The structure of the data can be gleaned from the code itself, but for facility's sake, it's organized like this:

```mermaid
graph LR
A(polls) --> B(poll1) --> C(question)
B --> D(answers)
D --> E(joker) --> F(name: Joker)
E --> G(votes: 39)
D --> H(ryuji) --> I(name: Ryuji)
H --> J(votes: 48)
```

And so on for all the possible answers.

### HISUI'S NEW POWER PLANT

I've solved this problem as thoroughly as I can with the given information [here](https://github.com/CutlerSheridan/polling-widget/blob/main/question-responses/powerPlant.md).

### BONUS

Take a look at my other project repos [here](https://github.com/cutlersheridan)! Browse the source code or the deployed GitHub Pages if you just want to see the end result. I have [a Todo app](https://cutlersheridan.github.io/todo/) that allows users to sign in with google and track their own tasks, [an I Spy game](https://cutlersheridan.github.io/i-spy/) that fetches the game images, which items to look for, and where those parts of the image are located from a database, and [a Battleship game](https://cutlersheridan.github.io/battleship/) that two people can play or you can play with an AI that will give you a run for your money, amongst other things.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Cutler Sheridan

#### TODO NEXT

- [MAYBE] add localStorage check to see if user has voted before or not (to prevent vote bombing)
  - maybe not thoughâ€”I like being able to see the pre-submit and post-submit stages of the UI by refreshing; not a huge deal if this particular project has someone submit more than once
